Overview of what you did:
For my project, I decided to make an lantern floating experience, where the user is in the dark and they get to release lanterns into the sky. There are mountains around you for scenery and candles in front of you. The point is that you can interact with everything and also have a cool experience. The reason I made it so dark was because it is suppoed to be night time, and you only have a flash light because you are in a field and cannot see a thing except when you look directly at it. I did all of this because I wanted to make it an experience instead of a game, a calming and fun experience. 

What was challenging:
What was challenging was destroying and instantiating the objects, and also applying physics to objects. It was easy to create the lanterns through HTML and then just make them all appear at once using Javascript, but I wanted a better experience so that every time you click the button is is like you release a singular lantern. So I figured out that I had to create the lanterns in a random position using Javascript. I then wanted to delete all of these lanters with a button, but I could not figure it out at all, so I ended up getting rif of one lantern at a time instead which I figured out how to do, and I ended up liking the idea better. It also took me a long time to get the physics to work, but in the end when I figured it out it was a great result. 

What went well:
What went well was how all of my ideas came together to create my experience. I wanted ot include lanterns, and a background scenery, and I ended up doing this well. I also ended up coming up with the idea to make candles using cylinders to have an object users can pick up and drop, as well as manipulate. This idea tied very well with the rest of my ideas and ended up looking great. Adding sound and shadows to my project also went well and I figured it out quite quickly.
